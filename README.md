# Meet App

## Description
Chat Chime is a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location. Data such as chat messages and images are stored in [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Firestore Databse and Storage). Chat UI is powered by [Gifted Chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat).

## User Stories
1. As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
2. As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
3. As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
4. As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
5. As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
6. As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

## Key Features
1. A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
2. A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
3. The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data.
